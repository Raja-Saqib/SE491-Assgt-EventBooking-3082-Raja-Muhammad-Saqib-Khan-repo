        Great! Here’s a **step-by-step guide** to properly using **`.env` files** in your microservices.

        ---

        # **✅ Step 1: Install dotenv Package**

        Since you are using **Node.js (Express.js for User & Booking Services)**, install `dotenv` in each service:

        ```sh
        npm install dotenv
        ```

        This package allows Node.js to **read environment variables** from a `.env` file.

        ---

        # **✅ Step 2: Create a `.env` File**

        Inside each microservice (**User Service, Booking Service, etc.**), create a `.env` file.

        ### **Example: User Service (`.env`)**

        ```
        DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:your_password@localhost:5432/user_service
        ```

        ### **Example: Booking Service (`.env`)**

        ```
        DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:your_password@localhost:5432/booking_service
        ```

        ---

        ### **✅ Step 3: Load `.env` in Your Code**

        Modify your **`db.js`** file to use `dotenv` for reading environment variables.

        ```javascript
        const { Pool } = require("pg");
        require("dotenv").config(); // Load environment variables

        const pool = new Pool({
            connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL, // Read from .env
        });

        pool.on("connect", () => {
            console.log("Connected to PostgreSQL!");
        });

        module.exports = pool;
        ```

        ---

        # **✅ Step 4: Use Database Connection in Express.js Routes**

        Example: Fetch all users from the **User Service** database.

        📌 **Inside `routes/users.js`**

        ```javascript
        const express = require("express");
        const router = express.Router();
        const pool = require("../db"); // Import database connection

        // Get all users
        router.get("/", async (req, res) => {
            try {
                const result = await pool.query("SELECT * FROM users");
                res.json(result.rows);
            } catch (err) {
                console.error(err.message);
                res.status(500).send("Server error");
            }
        });

        module.exports = router;
        ```

        ---

        # **✅ Step 5: Add `.env` to `.gitignore`**

        **Never commit `.env` files** to GitHub! Add this to your **`.gitignore`**:

        ```
        # Ignore environment files
        .env
        ```

        This ensures your **database credentials** are not exposed publicly.

        ---

        # **✅ Step 6: Set Environment Variables in Production**

        When deploying to **Docker, Heroku, AWS, or any cloud provider**, set **environment variables** instead of using `.env` files.

        📌 **Example: Setting Variables on Heroku**

        ```sh
        heroku config:set DATABASE_URL="postgresql://your_prod_db"
        ```

        📌 **Example: Using Docker**
        Modify `docker-compose.yml`:

        ```yaml
        services:
        user-service:
            environment:
            - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:your_password@db:5432/user_service
        ```

197. 

1️⃣ Add Retry Logic for Failed Notifications
✅ Fix: If an email/SMS fails, retry sending up to 3 times before marking as failed.

2️⃣ Standardized API Response Format
✅ Fix: Use successResponse() and errorResponse() for uniform responses.

3️⃣ Unified Error Handling
✅ Fix: Use next(error) instead of manually sending responses, ensuring all errors go through a central handler.

4️⃣ Consistent Logging & Status Updates
✅ Fix: Log every attempt and update notification status (pending → sent/failed).
